        <p>My name is Kelsey Gutschow and this is my portfolio.  Please feel free to take a look around
            and check out my recent projects. My background is not in coding. In fact it was in health
            care!  However, I felt the calling to try out coding. I needed to be creative, while also
            feeling challenged.  Now that I have learned the basics, I am ready to show off my skills! </p>

        <P> If you like what you see, then please reach out so we can collaborate on a project! In my spare
            time I like to bake, work on my photography skills, watch football with my boyfriend and hang out
            with our three goofball dogs. I'm always up for trying new foods too, so if you know of any good places
            in Tucson to check out, drop me a line and let me know. 
            I look forward to hearing from you!
