Here's HW #1! 

I just wanted to add a few notes, so you would know the issues I came across and the troubleshooting I tried.

1) The link to the picture was working before I uploaded the file to make it live. Once I pushed it to Github, it stopped working and give me the broken image symbol.  Not sure if this is a similar issue to what Ivana had with her links, or if for some reason I didn't add the picture to the images folder correctly. 

2) I clearly had issues with the design of the Nav Bar, but the links do work!

3) I had difficulty figuring out how to add a background image to the body.  Everything that I researched and found kept telling me to reference a URL, but the website you suggested for us only allowed us to download the image and I wasn't sure how to link it that way.  I did download the background I wanted to use and included it in my Images folder. 

I look forward to your feedback!
